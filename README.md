# DaydreamWeb

Display any website on your docked or charging Android device.

Website Daydream is an Android daydream – a screensaver-like app that is triggered when your device is plugged in or placed in a dock.

This daydream allows you to display any website in fullscreen on your device. You can choose whether touching the screen will scroll and interact with the web page, or wake your device.

With the ability to display any website, there’s a nearly endless number of things you could do:

- Have your favourite news website on display
- Display your personal / company website
- Create your own interactive daydreams with HTML5 canvas
- Show what’s ‘now playing’ on your home media centre.
- NEW: display any html file on your sdcard, even those created on the go.
